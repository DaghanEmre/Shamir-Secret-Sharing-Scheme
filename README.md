# Shamir-Secret-Sharing-Scheme
 Using and implementing polynomial operations addition and multiplication as a part of Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme

This experiment consist a simplified Shamir‟s Threshold encryption. Your
implementation will be named as shamir and must operate two functions:
1. It will calculate the main key for a given party and crypt a plain text with main key. This
function will run with parameter “–e”
2. It will find sub-polynomials of parties and will write them to text file. This function will
run with parameter “-l”
